It's hard to describe the taste to someone, as the picture of the guarana berries makes people think it tastes like cherries. The best way to describe it is as a cross between a lemon-lime soda and a citrus soda, like Sprite and Squirt mixed together. It's very light tasting, but very effervescent.

Now this isn't the best hot and sour soup I have ever had. To get that I would have to go back to Disney World and eat at the Chines resteraunt there wow that is good, sorry off track.  I did however find a soup that reall does come close to tasting like soup at my local buffet, which is more than I can say for 95% of the soup packets on here.  It is super easy just pour the goop provided into the bowl, add 3/4 cup water microwave a minute, you can eat it then, but if you wait about 5 minutes to let the flavor mingle wow, it really is good. You could take this to work, eat for lunch, a snack, 1 or 2 for supper, 1 if your not that hungry.

The Gnu bar was very tasty and the extra fiber worked its wonders.  I've been using Gnu bars for over two months now; one bar for breakfast, every day.  I still have to be careful to keep sugars out of my diet; however, because Gnu bars are low-glycemic the sugar in the bars do not cause any dumping syndrome and other similar side effect!

There's a lot of ways to diversify the flavor and nutritional value of this ramen - Instead of adding the dry vegetables from the packet (which imo are only there for aesthetics rather than nutrition), I usually add porta bella mushrooms, bok choy, green onions, garlic, brussel sprouts, sometimes rice, and a dash of sesame oil into the broth to make the most out of the lack of nutritional value. So good! You can get these veggies frozen in bulk too at your local grocery store. I also sometimes add a tiny bit of milk to make the broth creamier, or poach an egg.

In the city where I live, there aren't many Korean supermarkets and the stores that carry Shin usually sell it for $2 each. So this is a good deal for a college student trying to save some money.

If you're trying to cut back on all the sodium, never drink the entire broth, or use less than half the flavoring package when you make the soup. Just fyi!",Great college staple!,1422057600,7,4,0,0,1,1,0,0

I've been a tea drinker for decades, always in pursuit of a full, deep and well-balanced cup of tea, for breakfast or mid-day; especially, for convenience, in bag form.  This particular brew I would rate just one notch (barely) above standard Lipton or Tetley tea bags.  For a large cup of tea, at least two bags are needed to impart even the slightest hint of depth.  It smells interesting enough in the box, but there simply is no depth here.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by costlier loose teas over the years, and from some authentic Sri Lankan tea bags given to me by a close Sri Lankan friend.

I've been selling Stevia for years into the Nutraceutical Industry and been forced to use my companies expired samples for personal use because we don't sell under 5kg Qty. The cheap stuff sell 20 to 1 over the Gras level quality product.

 The garbage you commonly find on the market  [usually 90% Steviosides OR LESS] is 1/4 to 1/3 the price of this product, Available at a fraction of the cost  everyone markets the cheap stuff and depends on masking agents to cover the bitterness or just plain sells an inferior product. It's a shame that no one knows what true stevia tastes like. Truvia what a joke. [Explained Later]

When comparing Stevia look on the label. Does it say Reb A [Rebauside A] 97% or above, if it doesn't specifically mention  Reb A [Rebauside A] then it's the cheap stuff. Reb A is a constituent or Glycol of the Stevia Plant which is 200-300 times sweeter than sugar, 0 Calories, and approved by the FDA for Food.

I've sold and tasted the two and I can tell the difference, and the taste and concentration  of this product is spot on with authentic Gras caliber Stevia. By the way I don't sell to this marketer and don't have any interest other then to educate others.

This is the real deal. It does not have that bitter aftertaste associated with Stevia. It doesn't have dextrose or any fillers so you'll need a super small spoon or be prepared to use very small amount.

Stevia 95% and above has Gras or Generally Recognized as Safe. This means that the FDA has approved it for use in common food and beverages. Any lower grade Stevia has to be sold with a Dietary Supplement Warning Label.

This is the same stuff that they use in Truvia but without the Fermented Corn Starch, sorry meant to say erythritol, that they cut it with. Truvia is a joke, it is heavily cut Stevia, while I've been told that it's good in Coffee, I'm not a fan of fermented Sugar Alcohols.

From Live Strong
""Sugar alcohols such as erythritol are difficult for the body to digest, which can cause digestive problems if you eat too much. Symptoms include diarrhea, gas and bloating. The amount needed to cause symptoms varies greatly based on your individual tolerance. Some find that even small amounts of sugar alcohols upset their stomach, while others can tolerate higher amounts before they experience gastrointestinal symptoms.""

Until you've tasted this Stevia you aren't qualified to judge Stevia as a sweetener.

What it's good for:
Tea - Green Black pu-er Chai you name it and it works great.
Great to boost the sweetness of any Fruit Drink Such as Cranberry Juice
Great to boost the sweetness of any fruit such as Grape Fruit, or Black Berries, Blue Berries, Strawberry
Great to sweeten Yogurt, Cottage Cheese and Fruit
Smoothies etc..
Great with Vanilla

What it's not good for:
Coffee- Aargh Tastes Horrible Alone.
Hot Chocolate

Yes this product is more expensive then the commodity products but it's also much more expensive to manufacture and the marketers cost is higher too.
Try it!

The manufacturer has the nerve to say, on the side of the packet, that they ""select only the best ingredients"". Well, we hate to shatter anyone's illusions, but HFCS is NOT a quality ingredient - it's typically made from GM corn, and has no nutritional value whatsoever.

What it does have is the capacity to cause weight gain, along with many other consequent health issues.

We've said it before and we'll keep saying it until someone at Amazon listens - companies who sell any sort of consumable product, whether it's food, drinks or supplements (and especially those where it says you cannot return them, such as this one), should be forced to list ALL the ingredients on their sales page so that customers can make an informed choice, rather than trusting to luck and then having to return the product (which we shall be doing immediately) when they find it contains ingredients they can not or will not eat.

Cafejo included a k-cup sample selection: tea (1), coffee reg (2) & coffee decaf (1). The unit worked well with the K-cups and the coffees samples were very good tasting. For coffee pod use (no pod included) one stuffs a pod into the Cafejo k-cup adaptor--I would not waste a pod in that way.

This bread is ridiculously small. Not just smaller than an average loaf of bread, that's to be expected, given what you're buying.

I have bought this particular flaxseed a few times already and I really do enjoy it. My dad is the one who consumes most of this though.

I have taken this with water and it isn't too bad, although I recommend putting it in something that is a bit thicker like a protein shake, smoothie, or even backed goods.
I do think this has a nice taste to it when added to other drinks and backed foods. It gives it a fresh taste and it's good for you.
Although as I have seen others warn, if your digestive track is more sensitive or your just not used to products like this I would start out with a small dosage and work your way up as it can sometimes cause a little tummy issues if taken too much in the beginning.

This coconut is NOT coconut milk. It's the thick layer on top of the can of coconut we all want when making recipes that call for that thick, refrigerated layer. The taste is very creamy & smooth just as it is in canned varieties. I purchased this package because there are ZERO additives as there are in many canned brands.

The package is somewhat difficult to open so I used scissors to cut the top off. Once open, I added the cream directly to my recipes or added to a bowl & using an electric mixer, whipped it until light & fluffy before adding a bit of vanilla & monk fruit in the raw to make dairy free whipped cream.

The vast majority were yellow and green. Many were chipped; about four of them were smashed. The bag contained 159 lollipops rather than the promised 144, which is good. Unfortunately, the bag also contained about eight empty wrappers (no empty sticks tho), a bunch of loose candy fragments, and part of a cockroach. I have lowered my rating from four stars to one and will not be ordering these again.

First review: This is a huge collection of lollipops. I bought them to use for teaching phonetics (I needed the flat kind, not the ""ball"" kind of lollipop, and I couldn't find a smaller package) and my students had no complaints. They liked having the choice of flavors. Don't know how long it takes for candy to go stale because I could keep using these for another 4 semesters at least, there are so many.",More than I bargained for (and not in a good way--part of a cockroach!),1383350400,3,4,-1,,,,1,

-This particular product has pulp (pieces of coconut) inside. If you don't want the pulp, Taste Nirvana has a coconut water that doesn't have pulp
