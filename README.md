The first step involves data cleansing and preprocessing of the reviews. We conducted an initial labeling stage, assigning relevance scores to the reviews to filter out irrelevant ones and minimize their impact on our results. For clustering, we selected reviews with a relevance score above level 2. Our preprocessing also included removing stop words and punctuation, and retaining only English words. Notably, in an innovative approach to data preparation, we segmented our reviews into one, two, and three-word phrases before tokenizing, rather than directly tokenizing the entire reviews.This was followed by a second stage of labeling to determine the specific categories mentioned in each review, as previously introduced in earlier presentations.
